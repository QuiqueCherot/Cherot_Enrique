<h2> ¿Qué comemos? </h2>
Let's prettend that you are at home, maybe after working out, attend your studies or whetever... 
Suddenly the question is in your mind, and maybe you or anyone there with you say the words, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO EAT?

This web is here to help you avoid any discussion, or waste any time thinking what could you possible eat with the things you have at home?


## Here are a few things you can do:

  ► Use your own ingredients without any aditional.<br>
  ► Use your ingredients but only to take a good idea to cook.<br>
  ► Random pick: for that lazy day. Don't need to think.<br>
  ► Type of food (Vegan, meat, ...)
